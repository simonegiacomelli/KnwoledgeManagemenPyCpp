#Multi-language code search

In this project, we want to develop a search engine that can query a large multi-language (Python, C++) code repository. The subject of the indexing is TensorFlow, an open-source framework for machine learning and deep learning.



We want to extract all names of classes, functions and methods in *.cc and *.py files of the TensorFlow Github repository.
